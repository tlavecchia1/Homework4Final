Once & Never More","subtitle":"Introducing Anaconda Mosaic for Interactive Exploration & Transformation of Heterogenous Data","summary":"June 30, 2016\nIn today's fast-paced and data-driven world, analysts need to be able to explore and visualize data very quickly. Diagnosing a business problem involves looking at data from various angles - tabular and visual- and testing a large number of hypotheses. While there are technologies that can help a single analyst be more productive at querying and visualizing the data, these technologies do not assist in exposing hidden data transformations buried in spreadsheets.\nThat's why we've created Anaconda Mosaic. With Anaconda Mosaic, you'll never have to rewrite your transformations again. It empowers data scientists, quants and business analysts to interactively explore, analyze and visualize larger-than-memory datasets, while providing transformations that can be deployed against any data store.\n","date":"Thursday, June 30, 2016","image":{"src":"https://continuum.io/sites/default/files/mosaic.png","alt":""},"presenters":"Christine Doig","url":"https://go.continuum.io/visualize-explore-transform/","utm_campaign":"anaconda_mosaic","categories":""},{"id":"6","sticky":"false","title":"Bring Open Data Science Into Excel with Anaconda Fusion","subtitle":"Extend Data Science Models to Everyone Through Spreadsheets","summary":"June 24, 2016\nOpen Data Science brings powerful predictive technologies to your data through Python and R.
